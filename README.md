The Pregnancy Journey Tracker is a comprehensive web application designed to help expecting parents monitor and document their pregnancy journey. This Flask-based application provides an intuitive interface for tracking various aspects of pregnancy, from health metrics to photo documentation.

### Project Purpose

During pregnancy, parents need to track multiple aspects of their health and journey, which often involves using multiple apps or paper records. This application consolidates all essential tracking features into a single, user-friendly platform. The project aims to simplify pregnancy tracking while providing a meaningful way to document this special journey.

### Features

   - Secure registration and login functionality
   - Password hashing for security
   - User-specific data isolation
   - Due date tracking and week calculation

2. **Dashboard**
   - Weekly pregnancy progress visualization
   - Quick access to all tracking features
   - Summary of recent entries
   - Baby size comparisons based on current week

3. **Health Tracking**
   - Weight monitoring with history
   - Symptom logging (nausea, fatigue, mood, headaches)
   - Movement/kick counter with timer
   - Notes and observations for each entry

4. **Appointment Management**
   - Schedule medical appointments
   - Store doctor information and locations
   - View upcoming appointments
   - Appointment deletion functionality

5. **Photo Journal**
   - Upload and store pregnancy journey photos
   - Add captions and dates
   - Automatic week labeling based on due date
   - Secure file handling and storage

### Technical Implementation

The project is built using the following technologies:
